## Description  
This repository contains a workflow for predicting real estate prices in Belgium using data scraped from the Immoweb website. It includes code for data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the development of a **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNNRegressor)** model for price prediction.  

The goal of this project is to help the real estate company "ImmoEliza" to accurately estimate property prices based on features like property type, location, living area, number of rooms and other relevant attributes.

## Installation  
To run this project locally, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-price-prediction.git  
   cd real-estate-price-prediction  

---

## Usage
Follow the steps below to clean the data and train the model.

The code uses the example files present within the ./data folder. The ./figures folder has the graphs generated by the code

1. **Scrape data from immoweb.be**
   If you wish to redownload the latest data from immoweb.be use the folowing script to retrieve all the houses and apartments on sale in Immoweb
   ```python
   python scrape_immoweb/get_property_data.py
   ```

   If you already have a list of URLs for the properties based on which you want to train your model, use the following script to retrieve the features of the properties
   ```python
   python scrape_immoweb/get_property_links.py
   ```

2. **Preprocess the data**
   Once the features of the properties have been accessed, use the following script to clean the data
   ```python
   python clean_property_data.py

3. **Train a model and evaluate its performance**
   Train and develop a model for real estate price prediction 
   ```python
   python price_prediction.py
