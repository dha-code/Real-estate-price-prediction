## Description  
This repository contains a workflow for predicting real estate prices in Belgium using data scraped from the Immoweb website.</br>

It includes code for data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and developing a **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNNRegressor)** model for price prediction.  

This project aims to help the real estate company "ImmoEliza" accurately estimate property prices based on features such as property type, location, living area, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.

## Installation  
To run this project locally, follow these steps:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-price-prediction.git  
cd real-estate-price-prediction  
```

## Usage

The code uses the example files present within the ./data folder. The ./figures folder has the graphs generated by the code

1. **Scrape data from immoweb.be**</br>
   If you wish to re-download the latest data from [immoweb.be](https://www.immoweb.be/en?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=sea-br_all-reem_iwb_b2c_google_pure-brand_brand-protection_x_belgium_x_x_x_nl_x_x_text-exact_brand&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA19e8BhCVARIsALpFMgESPUhfbCp849gfp-BO0Ckbg3gSkVtEhas9IsIf5ityD0pXXzKlBBYaArJ9EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
 use the following script to retrieve all the houses and apartments on sale in Immoweb
   ```python
   python scrape_immoweb/get_property_data.py
   ```

   If you already have a list of URLs for the properties based on which you want to train your model, use the following script to retrieve the features of the properties
   ```python
   python scrape_immoweb/get_property_links.py
   ```

2. **Preprocess the data**</br>
   Once the features of the properties have been accessed, use the following script to clean the data
   ```python
   python clean_property_data.py

3. **Train a model and evaluate its performance**</br>
   Train and develop a model for real estate price prediction 
   ```python
   python price_prediction.py
