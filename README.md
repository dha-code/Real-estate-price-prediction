## Description  
This repository contains a workflow for predicting real estate prices in Belgium using data scraped from the Immoweb website. It includes code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the development of a **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNNRegressor)** model for price prediction.  

The goal of this project is to help the real estate company "ImmoEliza" to accurately estimate property prices based on features like property type, location, living area, number of rooms and other relevant attributes.
